Hello, I'm Joe.

I'm working as a Software Engineer on AWS for Amazon in Berlin. Previously, I graduated in Computing Science from the University of Glasgow. As the former President of the <a href="http://gutechsoc.com">Glasgow University Tech Society (GUTS)</a> I've organised loads of weekend long events for students including <a href="http://gutechsoc.com/cdx">Glasgow's Cyber Defence Exercise</a> and <a href="http://gutechsoc.com/hackathon">Scotland's largest Hackathon</a>.

I like learning about techniques for building scalable, resillient and highly available cloud services.

I'm also interested in playing folky tunes on guitar & harmonica.
