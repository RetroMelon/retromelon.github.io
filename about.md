Hello, I'm Joe.

I'm a final year student studying for a BSc. Hons. at the University of Glasgow. As the former President and current Secretary of the <a href="http://gutechsoc.com">Glasgow University Tech Society (GUTS)</a> I've organised loads of weekend long events including <a href="http://gutechsoc.com/cdx">Glasgow's Cyber Defence Exercise</a> and <a href="http://gutechsoc.com/hackathon">Scotland's largest Hackathon</a>.

I have most experience in webdev, having developed and deployed apps in Django on Linux and Spring(Boot) on Cloud Foundry which are currently in use in industry. I like learning about <a href="https://pivotal.io/cloud-native">Cloud Native</a> and <a href="https://12factor.net/">12-factor apps</a> and other techniques for building scalable, maintainable cloud applications

I'm also interested in machine learning, robotics and playing folky tunes on guitar & harmonica.
